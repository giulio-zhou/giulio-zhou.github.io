<h1>Hi I'm Giulio.</h1>

<p class="lead"> I'm a second year PhD in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Dave Andersen and Michael Kaminsky. I'm part of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Visual Computing Systems, working on enabling fine-grained video analysis with minimal human supervision. </p>

<p class="lead"> During my undergrad, I split my time between the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab, where I worked with Stuart Russell on probabilistic programming and the RISELab, where I worked with Joey Gonzalez on machine learning model serving. Previously, I was also a research assistant in a nanocrystal synthesis lab and software engineer at Google. </p>

<p class="lead"> I have also had the privilege to teach CS 61B (Data Structures and Algorithms) under Josh Hug and CS61BL under Sarah Kim and Alan Yao. Most recently, I served as a teaching assistant for CS 189 (Introduction to Machine Learning) under Ben Recht and Jitendra Malik.
