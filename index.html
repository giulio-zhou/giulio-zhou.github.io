<h1>Hi I'm Giulio.</h1>

<p class="lead"> 
  I'm a 4.5th year Computer Science major at UC Berkeley broadly interested in exploring how we can build scalable systems for the next generation of machine learning applications. I was previously a research assistant in a nanocrystal synthesis lab and software engineering intern at Google. Nowadays, I split my time between the Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) Lab, where I work under Stuart Russell on probabilistic programming systems for open-universe, probabilistic inference and the AMPLab, where I work under Joey Gonzalez on scalable systems for online, low-latency serving of machine learning models. I have also had the privilege to teach CS 61B under Josh Hug and CS61BL under Sarah Kim and Alan Yao. I'm currently a teaching assistant for CS 189 (Introduction to Machine Learning) under Ben Recht and Jitendra Malik.
